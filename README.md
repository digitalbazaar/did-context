See also (related specs):

* [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) - Data Model and Syntaxes][did-spec]
* [Decentralized Identifier Resolution](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/)

## Install

Requires [Node.js][] 8.3+

To install via [NPM][]:

```
npm install did-context
```

## Usage

```js
import didContext from 'did-context';
// or
const didContext = require('did-context');

// use URL in a JSON-LD context
const obj = {
  "@context": [
    didContext.CONTEXT_URL_V1,
    // ...
  ],
  // ...
};

// get context data for a specific context
const data = didContext.CONTEXT;
// ...
```

This package can be used with bundlers, such as [webpack][], in browser
applications.

## API

The library exports two properties:
- `constants`: A Object that maps constants to well-known context URLs. The
  main constant `DID_CONTEXT_URL` may be updated from time to time to the
  latest context location.
- `contexts`: A `Map` that maps URLs to full context data.

## Contribute

Code and packaging development is at the [did-context][] project. The contexts
themselves are developed in the [did-spec][] project.

Contexts in this package are updated manually from the [did-spec][] contexts.
Please file an issue if this package is not synced with [did-spec][] changes in
a timely manner.

Small note: If editing the Readme, please conform to the
[standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme) specification.
